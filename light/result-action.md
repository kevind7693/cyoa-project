# Results of your Actions
You rejected Lucifer's offer.

Lucifer, “I figured that would be your answer, whatever since I was told by my lord that if I can’t get you to join us, then I will have to kill you and wipe you off the face of this world.”

Your battle with Lucifer lasted 6 days and 6 nights. On the 7th day, Lucifer’s back was the first to touch the ground.

Lucifer, “Don’t think that killing me would save you. My lord will come after you until you are dead, his minions will keep on hunting you down till you are no more.”

You have finished the job, but now you only have one choice left. Help the humans win this war.
