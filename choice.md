# Choice?
You open your eyes to see what’s ahead, but you can only see darkness. You don’t remember what has happened to you. You only see darkness until you hear a voice in this endless darkness.    
  
Mysterious voice, “You have 2 choices as you are right now in this state, your next choice decides your fate. The choice is yours.”
  
With that you see 2 pathways one light, one dark.
  
What's your choice?
