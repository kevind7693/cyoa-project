# Final Decision
The demon king appalls you for your bravery. For many runs away in fear after just laying sight on him. You didn’t come here for a talk. You charged at him.

The demon king easily overpowered you. You can feel that death is near you. But the demon king didn't kill you yet. Instead he made you an offer.

“It would be a waste to kill someone of your caliber, come join the ranks of the 4 heavenly kings and absolute power would be yours.”

What do you say?
