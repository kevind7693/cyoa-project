# Mercenary
You could care less for this world. You only fight for your own benefit. With that, the people’s hope dies with this decision of yours. One day after finishing a bounty, you were approached by a hooded figure. You didn’t know who this figure was nor do you care.  
  
Hooded figure, “You seem like a good candidate for the position I am about to offer you.”
  
You told him to get to the point.  
  
Hooded figure, “Come join the demons. With your power as a hero, you can easily become a member of the 4 heavenly kings. With that comes great power. All you have to do is abandon that mortal body of yours and become a demon.”  
  
You ask, “Who are you really? I don’t believe that the demon king would send a lowlife to come make a deal with the former hero. If I were to make a guess at your real identity, I would say you are at least arch demon level. No you are different.”  
  
Hooded figure, “Oh, you manage to sense my aura that I suppressed. That's the former hero for you. You haven’t dulled one bit.”  
  
You say, “And you still have a sharp tongue as always. Isn’t that right, 4 heavenly kings number 3 Lucifer?”  
  
Lucifer, “You far surpassed my expectations hero.”  
  
Do you take my offer?
