# War
The frontline was worse than you thought. You see mountains of corpses from both sides. But both sides are not yielding to one another.

All of a sudden, you sense a dark presence. Who could be emitting this presence? It was then you saw a whole platoon was cut down before your eyes in a single slash. Now are are face to face with the demon king.

What would you do in this situation?
